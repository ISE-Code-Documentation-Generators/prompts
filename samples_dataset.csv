check this notebook by chris for more explanation on Coarse Dropout and Cutout
Coarse Dropout and Cutout augmentation are techniques to prevent overfitting and encourage generalization. They randomly remove rectangles from training images. By removing portions of the images, we challenge our models to pay attention to the entire image because it never knows what part of the image will be present. (This is similar and different to dropout layer within a CN.
Cutout is the technique of removing 1 large rectangle of random size
Coarse dropout is the technique of removing many small rectanges of similar size.
By changing the parameters below, we can have either coarse dropout or cutout. (For cutout, you'll need to add tf.random.uniform for random size. I leave this as an exercise for the reader."

- crop the whole animal, using shark/dolhin detector
- crop the fins alone, by training a fin detector (seems like what the competition description points t

It is used to visualize the distribution of numerical data. Unlike a box plot that can only show summary statistics, violin plots depict summary statistics and the density of each variable. On each side of the gray line is a kernel density estimation to show the distribution shape of the data. Wider sections of the violin plot represent a higher probability that members of the population will take on the given value, the skinnier sections represent a lower probability.

It is used to show the precision, recall, F1 Score, and support of your trained classification model. Some of the common terms associated with a classification report are as follows:
- Precision: Precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives.
- Recall: Recall is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.
- F1 Score: The F1 Score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The closer the value of the F1 score is to , the better the expected performance of the model is.
- Support: Support is the number of actual occurrences of the classes in the dataset. It doesn’t vary between models, it just diagnoses the performance evaluation process.

In this problem we'll be working with a simplified version of blackjack (aka twenty-on. In this version there is one player (who you'll contro and a dealer. Play proceeds as follows:
The player is dealt two face-up cards. The dealer is dealt one face-up card.
The player may ask to be dealt another card ('hit') as many times as they wish. If the sum of their cards exceeds 21, they lose the round immediately.
The dealer then deals additional cards to himself until either:
the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, in which case the player wins the round
the sum of the dealer's cards is greater than or equal to If the player's total is greater than the dealer's, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins (even in case of a ti.
When calculating the sum of cards, Jack, Queen, and King count for Aces can count as 1 or 11 (when referring to a player's ""total"" above, we mean the largest total that can be made without exceeding So e.g. A+8 = 19, A+8+8 = 17)
